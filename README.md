# The Weather Station

## Description

A browser app to view the current and five day forecast for any city in the world. This project gave me a lot of experience working with APIs. By using the geo-coordinates and the current and five day weather APIs I learned how to gather information from one API and feed it into a second as well.

## Installation

N/A

## Useage

Website is deployed at the following address: https://meduion.github.io/weather-station/

## Credits

Used a stackoverflow reply from Ivan Sivak to remove old search elements and make room for new ones, found at this address:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13125817/how-to-remove-elements-that-were-fetched-using-queryselectorall

Tutor Alistair Rowden assisted in optimizing the javascript, breaking it into discrete functions, and introducing the endsWith function to pull specific time data for the five day forecast.
